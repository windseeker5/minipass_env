# Activity Card Placeholder Fix - Verification Summary

## ✅ Fix Successfully Implemented

**Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Issue**: Activity cards without cover images displayed incorrectly - calendar icon was not centered and cards were too tall  
**Status**: **FIXED AND VALIDATED** ✅

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Activity cards on dashboard without cover images showed misaligned calendar icons
- The blue gradient placeholder background didn't properly center the calendar icon
- Cards appeared inconsistent in height compared to cards with actual images

### Root Cause
The `.img-responsive-21x9` Tabler.io class uses `padding-top: 42.86%` to maintain aspect ratio, but applying `display: flex` directly on this container interfered with the aspect ratio mechanism.

### Solution Applied
Changed the placeholder structure from:
```html
<!-- BEFORE (broken) -->
<div class="img-responsive img-responsive-21x9" style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
  <i class="ti ti-calendar-event"></i>
</div>
```

To:
```html
<!-- AFTER (fixed) -->
<div class="img-responsive img-responsive-21x9" style="position: relative;">
  <div style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
    <i class="ti ti-calendar-event"></i>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 📍 Files Modified

- **File**: `/templates/dashboard.html`
- **Lines**: 407-410 (desktop layout), 469-472 (mobile layout)
