# Enhanced File Removal System Requirements
# Standard library modules (included with Python 3.8+):
# - os
# - sys
# - stat
# - subprocess
# - shutil
# - tempfile
# - logging
# - pwd
# - grp
# - pathlib

# External dependencies (if needed):
pyfiglet>=0.8.0  # For ASCII art in manager interface (already in minipass_manager.py)

# System utilities that should be available on Ubuntu:
# - chattr (from e2fsprogs package)
# - lsof (from lsof package) 
# - sudo (from sudo package)
# - docker (from docker.io or docker-ce package)

# Note: The enhanced removal system is designed to gracefully handle
# missing system utilities by skipping those strategies and continuing
# with alternative approaches.
