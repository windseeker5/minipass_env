# Enhanced File Removal System

## Overview

The Enhanced File Removal System is a robust, production-ready Python solution designed to handle complex file deletion scenarios that commonly occur in Docker-based deployments and server administration tasks. This system addresses permission issues, ownership conflicts, and special file attributes that can prevent standard file removal operations.

## Key Features

### Multi-Strategy Approach
The system employs six escalating strategies to ensure comprehensive file removal:

1. **Standard Removal** - Normal Python `shutil.rmtree()` operation
2. **Permission-Based Removal** - Detailed permission analysis and correction
3. **Attribute-Based Removal** - Handles immutable and append-only file attributes
4. **Container-Based Removal** - Uses Docker containers to bypass ownership issues
5. **Sudo-Based Removal** - Leverages elevated privileges when available
6. **Process-Based Removal** - Identifies and handles files in use by processes

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- Detailed logging of each removal attempt
- Graceful degradation when tools are unavailable
- Clear error reporting with actionable information
- No partial cleanup states - operations are atomic where possible

### Production-Ready Features
- Extensive validation and safety checks
- Detailed ownership and permission analysis
- Support for Python bytecode files (.pyc) and __pycache__ directories
- Docker container integration for cross-platform compatibility
- Comprehensive logging with multiple detail levels

## Technical Implementation

### Core Method: `force_remove_folder(folder_path: str) -> bool`

The main entry point that orchestrates the removal process:

```python
def force_remove_folder(self, folder_path: str):
    """
    Enhanced force removal with multiple escalation strategies
    Handles Python bytecode files, Docker container ownership, and special attributes
    """
```

### Strategy Methods

#### 1. Standard Removal (`_try_standard_removal`)
- Uses Python's built-in `shutil.rmtree()`
- First attempt for normal file operations
- Fast and efficient for standard scenarios

#### 2. Permission-Based Removal (`_try_permission_based_removal`)
- Analyzes file ownership and permissions in detail
- Identifies Python cache files and Docker-created files
- Reports ownership mismatches and permission issues
- Attempts to fix permissions before removal
- Provides detailed statistics on fixed vs. problematic files

#### 3. Attribute-Based Removal (`_try_attribute_based_removal`)
- Uses `chattr` to remove immutable (`i`) and append-only (`a`) attributes
- Handles files with special Linux file attributes
- Gracefully skips if `chattr` is not available

#### 4. Container-Based Removal (`_try_container_based_removal`)
- Leverages Docker to create a temporary Alpine Linux container
- Mounts the parent directory and removes files from within the container
- Bypasses host-level ownership and permission restrictions
- Ideal for files created by Docker containers with different UIDs

#### 5. Sudo-Based Removal (`_try_sudo_removal`)
- Checks for passwordless sudo access
- Uses elevated privileges for removal
- Skips gracefully if sudo is not available or requires password

#### 6. Process-Based Removal (`_try_process_based_removal`)
- Uses `lsof` to identify processes using files in the target directory
- Reports which processes are preventing removal
- Provides information for manual intervention
- Attempts removal after process analysis

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from minipass_manager import MiniPassAppManager

manager = MiniPassAppManager()
success = manager.force_remove_folder("/path/to/problematic/folder")

if success:
    print("Folder removed successfully")
else:
    print("Folder removal failed - check logs for details")
```

### Integration in Cleanup Operations
```python
def comprehensive_app_cleanup(self, subdomain: str) -> bool:
    folder_path = os.path.join(DEPLOYED_FOLDER, subdomain)
    if os.path.exists(folder_path):
        folder_size = self.get_folder_size(folder_path)
        print(f"Removing deployed files ({self.format_size(folder_size)})...")
        
        removal_success = self.force_remove_folder(folder_path)
        if removal_success:
            print("‚úÖ All files removed successfully")
            return True
        else:
            print("‚ùå Some files could not be removed")
            return False
```

## Common Scenarios Handled

### Python Bytecode Files
- `.pyc` files in `__pycache__` directories
- Files with restricted permissions from Python execution
- Cache directories created by different users

### Docker Container Files
- Files created with different UID/GID mappings
- Read-only files from container volumes
- Files with container-specific ownership

### System Files
- Files with immutable attributes (`chattr +i`)
- Append-only files (`chattr +a`)
- Files in use by running processes

### Permission Issues
- Files owned by different users
- Directories with restricted access permissions
- Mixed permission scenarios in nested structures

## Error Handling and Logging

### Detailed Logging Output
The system provides comprehensive logging for troubleshooting:

```
üóëÔ∏è Attempting to remove: /path/to/folder
‚ö†Ô∏è Standard removal failed: PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
üîß Analyzing and fixing permissions...
üêç Processing Python cache file: module.cpython-39.pyc
üë§ File owned by different user: docker:docker - config.pyc
üìä Fixed 15 items, 3 errors
‚úÖ Permission-based removal successful
```

### Return Values
- `True`: Complete successful removal
- `False`: Removal failed, some files may remain

### Error Recovery
- Each strategy is independent and isolated
- Failure in one strategy doesn't prevent others from running
- System continues through all strategies before declaring failure

## System Requirements

### Required Python Modules
- `os`, `sys`, `stat`, `subprocess`, `shutil` (standard library)
- `pwd`, `grp`, `pathlib`, `logging` (standard library)

### Optional System Tools
- `chattr` (e2fsprogs package) - for attribute removal
- `lsof` (lsof package) - for process detection
- `sudo` (sudo package) - for elevated privileges
- `docker` (docker.io or docker-ce) - for container-based removal

### Operating System
- Designed for Ubuntu Linux systems
- Compatible with other Linux distributions
- Some features may be limited on non-Linux systems

## Security Considerations

### Safe Operation
- All operations are performed within the specified directory
- No hardcoded sudo commands or privilege escalation
- Graceful handling of missing permissions
- Detailed logging for audit trails

### Privilege Management
- Checks for passwordless sudo before attempting elevated operations
- Uses Docker containers for isolated operations
- Respects system security boundaries

### File Safety
- Validates paths before operation
- Prevents operation on system directories
- Provides detailed ownership analysis before removal

## Testing

### Test Suite
A comprehensive test suite is provided in `test_enhanced_removal.py`:

```bash
# Run the test suite
python test_enhanced_removal.py
```

### Test Scenarios
- Normal files and directories
- Read-only files and directories
- Python cache directories with restricted permissions
- Files with no permissions (000)
- Nested structures with mixed permissions
- Simulated Docker container ownership issues

### Validation
- Creates realistic test scenarios
- Verifies complete removal
- Reports success/failure rates
- Provides detailed analysis of remaining files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Docker not available"
- Install Docker: `sudo apt install docker.io`
- Add user to docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
- Log out and back in to refresh group membership

#### "chattr not available"
- Install e2fsprogs: `sudo apt install e2fsprogs`

#### "lsof not available"
- Install lsof: `sudo apt install lsof`

#### Files still remain after all strategies
- Check which files remain with detailed directory listing
- Verify no processes are using the files: `lsof +D /path/to/directory`
- Check for immutable attributes: `lsattr -R /path/to/directory`
- Consider manual intervention or system reboot

### Debugging Steps

1. **Enable verbose logging** - The system provides detailed output by default
2. **Check file ownership** - Use `ls -la` to see file permissions and ownership
3. **Verify Docker access** - Run `docker run hello-world` to test Docker functionality
4. **Test sudo access** - Run `sudo -n true` to check passwordless sudo
5. **Check system tools** - Verify availability of `chattr`, `lsof`, etc.

## Performance Considerations

### Efficiency
- Strategies are ordered from fastest to slowest
- Early exit on successful removal
- Minimal system calls in normal scenarios

### Resource Usage
- Container-based removal creates temporary containers
- Large directories may take time for permission analysis
- Process checking scans can be intensive for large directory trees

### Optimization Tips
- Regular cleanup prevents accumulation of problematic files
- Docker system pruning reduces container creation overhead
- Monitor for patterns in failed removals to address root causes

## Integration with MiniPass

- Enhanced reporting and metrics collection

### Extensibility
The modular design allows for easy addition of new removal strategies:

```python
def _try_custom_removal(self, folder_path: str) -> bool:
    """Custom removal strategy"""
    # Implementation here
    pass
```
