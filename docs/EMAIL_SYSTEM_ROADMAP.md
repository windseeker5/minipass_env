# Minipass Email System — Master Roadmap

**Last Updated:** February 16, 2026
**Branch:** `feature/email-infrastructure-overhaul` (merged to main: commit `92b0813`)

---

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

```
Pass Rate:    96.9% (222/229 messages)
DKIM:         100% ✅
SPF (direct): 100% ✅
DMARC policy: p=none (monitor only)
Gmail ban:    RESOLVED (Feb 12, 2026)
```

### Email Volume (Jan 11 – Feb 12, 2026)
- **62 emails/day** average outbound
- **74% go to Gmail** addresses (2,415 / 3,255 total)
- **lhgi@minipass.me** = 89% of outbound traffic (938 of 1,923 sent)
- During Gmail ban: 40.9% failure rate (now resolved)

---

## What's Done

### Phase 1 — RFC 5322 Compliance ✅
- `app/utils.py` — Added `Date`, `Return-Path`, `Auto-Submitted`, `Message-ID` headers + UTF-8 charset
- `MinipassWebSite/utils/email_helpers.py` — Same headers added to `send_user_deployment_email()` and `send_password_reset_email()`
- Both email systems are now fully RFC 5322 compliant

### DMARC Monitoring Infrastructure ✅
- `scripts/fetch_dmarc_reports.py` — Auto-fetches DMARC reports via IMAP from 5 providers (Google, Microsoft, Yahoo)
- `scripts/analyze_dmarc_failures.py` — Analyzes failures and generates Markdown reports
- `scripts/email_monitor_to_db.py` — SQLite persistence for email health metrics (running on VPS)
- Cron job on VPS: daily DMARC fetch at 10 AM
- Sieve filter on `kdresdell@minipass.me` — blocks DMARC reports from forwarding to Gmail (prevents the forwarding loop that caused the Feb 8 ban)

### Monitoring Scripts ✅
- `scripts/email_health_check.py` — Queries `email_log` table, alerts if success rate < 95%
- `scripts/verify_email_rfc_compliance.sh` — Verifies SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MX, PTR records

## Failure Analysis (96.9% Pass Rate)

### Issue 1 — `mail.minipass.me` domain (2 failures) ❌ FIX THIS
System emails (postmaster, root) are sent with `From: mail.minipass.me` instead of `From: minipass.me`.
DKIM and SPF fail because authentication is configured for `minipass.me` only.

**Fix (run on VPS):**
```bash
docker exec mailserver postconf -e "myorigin = minipass.me"
docker exec mailserver postconf -e "smtp_helo_name = minipass.me"
docker restart mailserver
```

**Verify:**
```bash
docker exec mailserver postconf myorigin smtp_helo_name
```

### Issue 2 — Forwarded emails (5 failures) ✅ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
Emails forwarded from external domains (telus.com, jfgoulet.com) always break SPF alignment.
DKIM passes, which is sufficient for Gmail delivery. This is industry-standard behavior, not a real problem.

### Expected after fix
```
Pass Rate:    98-99%
DKIM:         100% ✅
SPF (direct): 100% ✅
Forwarded:    ~2% SPF fail (expected, DKIM passes)
```

---

## Phase 2 — DMARC Policy Upgrade

**Prerequisite:** Fix `mail.minipass.me` issue above and confirm 98%+ pass rate for 30 days.

### Step 1: Quarantine (Week 6 from fix)
Change DNS TXT record for `_dmarc.minipass.me`:
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; pct=10; rua=mailto:kdresdell@minipass.me
```
- Only 10% of failing emails get quarantined
- Monitor deliverability for 2 weeks
- Increase to `pct=50`, then `pct=100` over 4 weeks

### Step 2: Reject (Week 20 from fix, if stable)
```
v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:kdresdell@minipass.me; ruf=mailto:kdresdell@minipass.me
```
- Maximum spoofing protection
- Only do this after 99%+ pass rate sustained for 90 days

### DMARC Upgrade Timeline
| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| Now  | Fix `mail.minipass.me` issue |
| +1   | Confirm 98% pass rate |
| +2–5 | Monitor stability |
| +6   | `p=quarantine; pct=10` |
| +8   | `p=quarantine; pct=50` |
| +10  | `p=quarantine; pct=100` |
| +20  | `p=reject` (if stable) |

## Phase 3 — Email Size Optimization (Deferred)

**Trigger:** Only needed if Gmail blocks resume or email size becomes an issue.

Current email size: ~32KB–105KB (inline base64 images)
Target: ~8KB (75% reduction via hosted images)

**Plan:** Host images on CDN/static server, replace base64 inline images with HTTP URLs in email templates.
**Effort:** ~6–8 hours

---

## Phase 4 — Email Analytics Dashboard (Deferred, Month 2+)



**Trigger:** When operational visibility becomes a priority.

**Plan:** Simple Flask dashboard on top of `email_monitor_to_db.py` SQLite data showing:
- Daily/weekly inbound/outbound volume per sender/domain
- Authentication pass rate trends
- Alerts for volume spikes

**Effort:** ~4–6 hours

---

## Phase 5 — Transactional Email Service (Only if Needed)

**Trigger:** Only consider if Gmail blocks resume after Phases 1–2, or volume exceeds 5,000 emails/day.

Current architecture (self-hosted docker-mailserver) is fine for current scale. Keep it.

| Service | Cost at ~1,900/mo | Cost at 186k/mo | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Self-hosted | $0 | $0 | Current, requires maintenance |
| AWS SES | $0.19 | $18.60 | Best value at scale |
| SendGrid | $0 (free tier) | $89.95 | Easy setup |
| Postmark | $15 | $279 | Best deliverability reputation |

**Recommendation:** Stay self-hosted. AWS SES as fallback if deliverability problems persist.
